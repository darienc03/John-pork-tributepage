                <p>John Pork lived a prosperous lifestyle. After investing early into the now juggernaut "pork coin" 
                    he was able to create a luxurious life for himself. He's climbed to the top of Mount Everest and has sailed the world twice.
                    He has captured his adventures via his social media accounts that have gotten very popular over the years. 
                    He was then able to use his following to create change in many humanitarian efforts funded through his foundation.
                    John won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Porktown Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>John leaves behind his wife Julia, and his six children Jill, Jackie, Jennifer, Janet, Joe and Bob.</p>
